### Summary of Conversation:
There is a huge problem that we were unable to pass, the PHP db unit testing has been discontinued, and there is no further support for this functionality. We tried to roll back or downgrade to a version that supports Database testing however it was futile. We decided to focus on testing of the Maps api wiht Javascript unit testing and it is going well. So far we have done the price implementation in the website. The distance is coming along nicely. We also have a get user location function implementation.

In order to test whether the distance is working in relation with the users location, we will need to spoof the location. A member of ours found out that the browser google can provide that to us easily. We have only 1 user story point to do and that is us finished just in time for the sprint review.
